Welcome to RetroLemmini!

A clone of the DMA Design game Lemmings(TM) with graphics from Lemmings For Windows 95

Instructions for installation:

1) Ensure that you have a copy of the latest version of Java installed on your system.

For the JRE (good if you just want to run Java applications), go here:
https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

For the JDK (good if you intend to do some Java programming of your own!), go here:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

2) Copy across any levels, mods, music, player data, replays, sounds and styles
   from your existing (Super)Lemmini(Too) installation into the relevant folder
   within the "resources" folder
   
   (NOTE: "RLEditor.exe is a dedicated level editor for RetroLemmini.")
   
   (NOTE: "LemminiLevelPackCompiler.exe can be used to easily group levels into packs.")
   
   (NOTE: The "docs" folder contains some useful documentation for help with
   using RetroLemmini including hotkeys, cheat codes, level formatting, etc.)
   
   (NOTE: The "icons" folder contains .ico files that you can optionally
   use to create a Windows shortcut for RetroLemmini - see below for details)
   
   (NOTE: The "lib" folder contains all of the library dependencies
   that RetroLemmini needs to run, you don't need to do anything with these)
